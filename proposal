Topic: Investigation in the relationship of the speed of the car and the angles of the road.

Introduction: 

In this laboraty, Iâ€™m going to relate distance travelled of the object from different dropping angles untill it stop.

My variables are the mass and shape of the object, the rolling surface, the time for the objects rolling, the speed of the object and the distance travelled of the object.  The independent variable is the angles of the surface because I choose it and the speed because of the change in angles.
