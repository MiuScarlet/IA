Topic: Investigation in the relationship of the speed of the car and the angles of the road.

Introduction: 

In this laboraty, Iâ€™m going to relate distance travelled of the object from different dropping angles untill it stop.

My variables are the mass and shape of the object, the rolling surface, the time for the objects rolling, the speed of the object and the distance travelled of the object.  The independent variable is the angles of the surface because I choose it. The dependent variable is the bouncing time T and the speed because of the change in angles. The constants must be the mass of the object, bouncing surface because they are going to be the same during the whole experiment. 
The question to answer is how the angles is related to the distance travelled by the object. I will look for a linear and proportional relationship between the independent and dependent variables. My idea is if the height angles, the distance will also increase.
